# Recognizing and Minimizing Bias in Online News Consumption 
## Made as part of an entry for the Mozilla MVP Lab Summer 2020
### Offered a place in the Mozilla Open Lab 2020

We live in a world with rampant partisanship which is also reflected on the internet. Prominent news networks often use loaded language to appeal to emotion. They also look to reinforce divisions by omitting information that detracts from causes championed by their side of the political divide, sometimes fundamentally undermining the truth value of the news they report. While fake news in the form of deliberate rumors is a huge problem, even reasonably aware individuals who avoid the fake news traps often succumb to years of conditioning from tone-manipulated news.

The internet should a way to help users familiarize and engage themselves with opposing ideas in a safe manner. Unfortunately, this is not our reality - online comment threads often turn into hostile wit contests, and most content out there is laced with some political messaging. Veritas can help change that by allowing users to switch between news reporting on a political spectrum in real-time, thereby facilitating easier comparison between the wording-tones adopted by news websites. Our hope is that Veritas can help the internet play its part in helping individuals arrive at more educated political opinions.
